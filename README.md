> This readme file contains all the answers to the questions asked in the challenge. It follows the same structure as the challenge instruction document.

## Basic

A. See the `insertionSort` function in the [sortings.js](docs/01_Basic_A/sortings.js) file.
I commented the code to explain the different steps. By running `npm run basic:a` you can get the estimation of executing the `insertionSort` function 10 billion of times.

Output example:

```
Time of sorting 10000000 arrays: 1638 ms
Estimated time of sorting One billion arrays: 1638000 ms
In seconds: 1638 s
```

## Practical

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
